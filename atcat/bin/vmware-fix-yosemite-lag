# If you're running VMware Fusion, you may have noticed that when you
# run a Yosemite VM, the framerate is about 10fps and hardly usable.
#
# A program called "BeamOff" fixes that.  More info:
#
#   https://github.com/rtrouton/rtrouton_scripts/tree/master/rtrouton_scripts/fix_yosemite_vm_graphic_performance
#
# "When I tested the compiled BeamOff application, I saw a considerable
# improvement in how fast the VM was now responding. The window redraw
# issues I had previously seen were now also addressed, where windows
# were now being refreshed correctly regardless if they were in the
# background or foreground."
#
# This script downloads rtrouton's BeamOff installer, which:
# - installs /Applications/BeamOff.app
# - configures /Library/LaunchAgents to launch it on login.
